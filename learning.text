# Essential Concepts for Working on This FastAPI Invoice Generator Project
To effectively work on this FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) compliant invoicing system, you'll need to understand these key concepts:

## üêç Backend Technologies (Python/FastAPI)
### Core Framework & API
- FastAPI : Modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python
- Uvicorn : ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
- Pydantic : Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations
- SQLModel : SQL databases in Python, designed to work with FastAPI (combines SQLAlchemy + Pydantic)
### Database & ORM
- PostgreSQL : Advanced relational database system
- SQLAlchemy : Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Alembic : Database migration tool for SQLAlchemy
- Database Relationships : Understanding foreign keys, one-to-many, many-to-one relationships
### Authentication & Security
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) : For stateless authentication
- OAuth2 : Authentication framework
- Password Hashing : Using bcrypt for secure password storage
- CORS : Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for API access
### Business Logic Libraries
- ReportLab : PDF generation for invoices
- Pandas : Data manipulation and analysis
- OpenPyXL : Excel file processing
- XML Processing : lxml, xmltodict for FBR API integration
## ‚öõÔ∏è Frontend Technologies (React/TypeScript)
### Core Framework
- React 18 : Component-based UI library
- TypeScript : Typed superset of JavaScript
- Vite : Fast build tool and development server
### UI & Styling
- Chakra UI : Simple, modular, and accessible component library
- React Icons : Popular icon library
- Next Themes : Theme management (dark/light mode)
### State Management & Data Fetching
- TanStack Query (React Query) : Powerful data synchronization for React
- TanStack Router : Type-safe router for React applications
- Axios : HTTP client for API requests
### Forms & Validation
- React Hook Form : Performant, flexible forms with easy validation
- Zod : TypeScript-first schema validation
- Hookform Resolvers : Integration between React Hook Form and validation libraries
### Data Display & Interaction
- TanStack Table : Headless UI for building tables
- React Select : Flexible select input control
- React DatePicker : Date picker component
- React Dropzone : File upload with drag and drop
### File Processing
- jsPDF : PDF generation in the browser
- html2canvas : Screenshots of DOM elements
- XLSX : Excel file processing
- File-saver : Save files on the client-side
## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Patterns
### API Design
- RESTful APIs : Understanding HTTP methods, status codes, resource naming
- OpenAPI/Swagger : API documentation and client generation
- CRUD Operations : Create, Read, Update, Delete patterns
### Database Design
- Entity Relationship Modeling : Understanding business entities and their relationships
- Database Normalization : Organizing data to reduce redundancy
- Foreign Key Constraints : Maintaining data integrity
### Software Architecture
- Separation of Concerns : Models, Views, Controllers/Services
- Dependency Injection : Managing dependencies between components
- Repository Pattern : Abstracting data access logic
## üíº Business Domain Knowledge
### FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) Compliance
- Pakistani Tax System : Understanding GST, sales tax, withholding tax
- Invoice Requirements : Mandatory fields, tax calculations
- HSN Codes : Harmonized System of Nomenclature for products
- Tax Rates : Different tax types and their calculations
### Invoicing Business Logic
- Customer Management : Registered vs unregistered customers
- Product Catalog : Managing products with tax information
- Invoice Lifecycle : Draft ‚Üí Submitted ‚Üí Posted ‚Üí Error states
- Tax Calculations : Complex tax computations for Pakistani market
## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools & Practices
### Development Environment
- Virtual Environments : Python venv for dependency isolation
- Package Management : pip, npm for dependency management
- Environment Variables : Configuration management with .env files
### Code Quality
- Type Checking : MyPy for Python, TypeScript for frontend
- Linting : Ruff for Python, Biome for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Testing : Pytest for backend, Playwright for E2E testing
- Pre-commit Hooks : Automated code quality checks
### DevOps & Deployment
- Docker : Containerization for consistent environments
- Docker Compose : Multi-container application orchestration
- Database Migrations : Version control for database schema changes
